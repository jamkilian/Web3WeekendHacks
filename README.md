Repo for Web3 Weekend development

# Goal
We wanted to create an net-positive incentive for fans to share their favorite tracks. The initial idea is to have an NFT associated with an Audius track and a smart contract. The concept is that on passing the album/track NFT to the next listener, they earn the potential of withdrawing a share from the NFT's piggybank. 


# Work of Note
./postman contains our Postman configurations and testing, using the Audius API to gather information on tracks.
main.go demonstrates our API usages.
next-bucket/ was used to start exploring IPFS and Filecoin. We were able to build with the framework, get a file created and uploaded: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeihqth3d3whlfjdxyf52kjlakzkl4n2nmxlfbg43yhgjgi3n3zfsre
YourContract.sol shows some initial smart contract work on the TravelingAlbum idea.
